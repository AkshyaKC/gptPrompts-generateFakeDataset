Generate a Python script using the Faker library to create a downloadable CSV dataset with 10,000 rows of patient medical history in a hospital. 

The columns should include: ***Patient ID, Age, Gender, Chronic Conditions, Past Hospitalizations, Medications, Procedures, Length of Stay, Follow-up Appointments, Discharge Instructions, Insurance Type, Access to Care***

The "Procedures" column should be categorized into:

1. Diagnostic Tests: Blood Test, X-ray, MRI Scan, CT Scan, Ultrasound
2. Surgeries: Appendectomy, Cholecystectomy, Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery, Hip Replacement, Knee Arthroscopy
3. Therapeutic Procedures: Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy, Dialysis, Physical Therapy
4. Minor Procedures: Biopsy, Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, Skin Lesion Removal, Wound Care

Each patient can have multiple procedures, medications, and chronic conditions. Ensure the script uses realistic values and includes the necessary imports.
